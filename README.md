# Bank_stock_finance_analysis
This repository uses a pickle dataset which in layman terms is one which serialize and deserialize the data.
I'm using 'all_banks' dataset, which is provided here which cotains financial information of several US banks.
I'm using it to do some data visualisation to practice.
The plots using iplot are not on display here because plotY wouldnt allow it. I did make an account on plotY but it didnt show up here, though if you use this code on jupyter notebook, it will surely run. All you have to do is to import ploty and cufflinks.
